# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

#### Problem:

The planet is warming and the human made climate emergency is causing exaggerated extreme droughts that destroy ecosystems and food supplies in one season and storms that flood areas in the next. The impacts of climate change always hit the poorest most and Madagascar has been an African island hit hard by the whims of a changing climate.&#x20;

Severe drought has caused decades of food shortages leaving more than a million people without food security. A large portion of these face life-threatening famine-like conditions. Often the only way to feed the family is by cutting and selling wood. A devastating 854,000 hectares of forest have been lost between 1990 and 2005 alone.&#x20;

The consequences of deforestation are daunting and have harmed Madagascarâ€™s biodiversity, soil, water, atmosphere and climate.
