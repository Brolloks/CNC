# ðŸ‘‹ Summary

#### Problem:

The planet is warming and a human induced climate shift is causing both extreme droughts, and storm related flooding, destroying entire ecosystems and food supplies in sensitive areas. The impacts of climate change inevitably affect the poorest populations most, and this is especially true in the island nation of Madagascar.\


Madagascar is one of the ten poorest countries in the world. Severe drought has caused decades of food shortages, leaving more than a million people without food security. A large portion of these face life-threatening, famine-like conditions. Farmers resort to felling of endemic natural forests for wood, charcoal, or growing rice. In Madagascar, a devastating 854,000 hectares of forest have been lost between 1990 and 2005 alone (1). Deforestation has ravaged Madagascarâ€™s biodiversity, soil, water, atmosphere and transformed the local climate. Deforestation leads to further erosion of fertile topsoil, increased evaporation and desertification, in turn creating a feedback loop if the cycle is not broken. To make matters worse, though Madagascar has only 0.5% of the earthâ€™s landmass, it has 5% of all species, 80% of which are found nowhere else on Earth (2). Madagascar has several critically threatened species including the Silky Sifaka, a lemur, which is one of the rarest mammals on earth. Its nameâ€”â€œangel of the forest"â€”refers to its white fur. (3).



#### Vision:

> Agroecology can offer solutions to significantly, and permanently, improve the situation for communities and ecosystems in central Madagascar.

Climate Neutral Cardano now proudly announces the CNC project, a regenerative agriculture and reforestation project in Madagascar, in conjunction with an ISPO launch of the CNC token. CNC is partnering with Tetikasa Ala, a Madagascar NGO to implement the CNC program.
