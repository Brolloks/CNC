# A blockchain solution for good

Running blockchain infrastructure can generate income that can be used to fund fabulous charity projects that act on the climate crisis. However, using the wrong blockchain can mean that all the good achieved by the donations is negated by the negative impacts of using that blockchain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Bitcoin requires ‘mining’ that uses similar amounts of energy to countries like Norway to achieve its security through its Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol (6). This is just not sustainable and is indeed unnecessary if the same and more functionality can be achieved by other blockchains running a much more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This PoS protocol does not require electricity for ‘mining’ and instead uses less than a fraction of Bitcoins energy demand. Indeed publications show Cardano uses at least 10.000 times less energy (7,8) than Bitcoin.

**Cardano** is the first PoS blockchain that proves that its Ouroboros protocol is just as secure as the Bitcoin blockchain (5). This difference is very important when we talk about the fight against global heating, because it allows Cardano to be secure without the wasteful use of energy required for ‘mining’. Furthermore, it allows Cardano to be run anywhere in the world, including poorer nations, without wasting essential resources.

Behind Cardano stands a mission-driven global community with the goal to make this world a better place.

The CNCAla project is a brainchild of the Climate Neutral Cardano Community of Stake Pools. Our project funding aims to remove CO2 from the air and will help turn the negative impact onto the climate into a positive one. Even better, we connect and bond with the Tetikasa Ala community in Madagascar and create a partnership with unlimited possibilities.
