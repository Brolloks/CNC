# The Problem

{% hint style="danger" %}
People are dying from heat and starvation.

Weather stations report the highest temperatures on record, again.

In the global south droughts have devastated food supplies and the East of Africa is suffering the most. The south of Madagascar is particularly hard hit by a prolonged drought ongoing for several years, causing millions of people to starve.&#x20;

(2) The forecast for 2022 is not going to be any better, and this extreme weather can be directly related to global warming. The planet has warmed just above 1C since the start of the industrial revolution and the destructive consequences are now visible everywhere. However, the impacts are felt much worse in poorer countries like Madagascar, despite that they never caused the emissions responsible for the warming.

The impacts of the drought are much worse due to the ongoing and widespread deforestation on the island. From 2001 to 2021, **Madagascar lost 4.36Mha of tree cover**, equivalent to a 25% decrease in tree cover since 2000 (3). The causes of this deforestation are agriculture, population increase, collection of firewood and timber harvesting (4).

This deforestation causes ecosystem destruction & biodiversity loss on a large scale and nowhere is that worse than in Madagascar, an island which is classed as a biodiversity hotspot and home to thousands of unique plant and animal species you can find nowhere else in the world.
