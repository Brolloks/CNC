# The Problem

{% hint style="danger" %}
People around the world are dying from heat, starvation, and extreme weather events.&#x20;

Weather stations report the highest temperatures on record, again, and again. In the southern hemisphere, droughts have devastated food supplies and the East of Africa is suffering the most. The south of Madagascar is particularly hard hit by a prolonged drought ongoing for several years, causing millions of people to starve (4).&#x20;

The forecast for 2022 is not going to be any better, and this extreme weather can be directly related to global warming. The planet has warmed just above 1Â°C since the start of the industrial revolution and the destructive consequences are now visible everywhere. However, the impacts of climate change are felt more deeply in poverty stricken countries like Madagascar, despite the fact that per capita emissions are only 0.12 tonnes or 2% of an average UK citizen (5).

The impacts of the drought are exacerbated due to the ongoing and widespread deforestation on the island. From 2001 to 2021, **Madagascar lost 4.36Mha of tree cover, equivalent to a 25% decrease in tree cover since 2000 (6)**. The causes of this deforestation are: poor agricultural practices, population increase, unsustainable collection of firewood, and timber harvesting (7).&#x20;

**Deforestation collapses natural ecosystem life cycles & accelerates biodiversity loss on a large scale**. Nowhere is this more prominent than in Madagascar, an island which is world renowned for its biodiversity, home to thousands of unique plant and animal species you can find nowhere else in the world.
