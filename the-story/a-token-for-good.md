  Thanks to the functionality of Cardano, we can create our own native token. A
  token that will be standing for all the donations and the embedded carbon in
  this project.

# A token for good

In order to distribute and showcase the benefits of this project we wanted to give back to the delegators in the form of a token offering. Because every delegator enables the participating Stake Pools to make blocks and thereby help them to generate the funding for the CNCAla project.

The CNCAla-token will represent the environmental, economical and social value of the project outputs. The token will be made specifically for this project and represent the CO2 removed by the planted trees in Madagascar.

More so, the token will provide you with the ability to vote for the next projects our community will fund and on top of that we have a little extra.

A group of four NFT artists and climate activists at heart specifically committed to make and gift their own NFT series to CNCAla token holders at the end of the ISPO.
