  Thanks to the innate functionality of Cardano’s eUTXO model, we can construct
  our own native token which shares the same security & efficiency features of
  the parent chain.

# A token for good

A token that will represent all the donations and the embedded carbon of this project.

In order to distribute and showcase the benefits of this project we wanted to give back to the delegators in the form of a token offering. Because **every delegator enables the participating stake pools to produce blocks** and thereby help them to generate the funding for the CNCAla project.&#x20;

Token benefits include the following:

* [x] The CNCAla token will represent the environmental, economic and social value of the project outputs. The token will be made specifically for this project and represent the CO² removed by the trees planted in Madagascar.
* [x] The token will provide the token holder with the ability to vote for future projects our community will fund.
* [x] The token will make you eligible for highly desirable NFT’s. A group of four recognized NFT artists and organisations committed to make and gift bespoke NFT series to CNCAla token holders at the end of the ISPO.
