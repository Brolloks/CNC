# An Agroecology solution

{% hint style="info" %}
Agroecology has emerged as the discipline that provides the basic ecological principles for how to study, design and manage agroecosystems that are both productive and natural resource conserving, and that are also culturally sensitive, socially just and economically viable (Altieri 1995).

Benefits of Agroecology and potential impact for nature and people:

Local agroecology will create vegetation and forest cover while feeding the majority of the population. Bringing the local population along also combats deforestation and trains a new generation of sustainable farmers that thrive.

Switching from destructive farming systems that destroy the soil and forests, to agroecology principles will provide multiple benefits to nature and farmers…. Paint a picture of the future (waiting for some input from Elliot)

We were lucky to find Tetikasa Ala, a Non-Profit Organisation, created in 2019 and located in France and Madagascar with the goal to reintroduce agroecology and fight against the deforestation of Madagascar. Tetikasa Ala stands for ‘Project Forest’ in malagasy and is run by lovely people with a connection to the land and the expertise to do things more sustainably. Together we set ourselves a goal of planting 100.000 trees on 20 hectares of land. All they needed was some funding to keep going… and we thought it would make a real difference if our group of Cardano Stake Pools could fund their operations through an ISPO.
