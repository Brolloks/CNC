# An Agroecology solution

{% hint style="info" %}
Agroecology has emerged as the discipline that provides the basic ecological principles for how to study, design and manage agroecosystems that are both productive and natural resource conserving, and that are also culturally sensitive, socially just and economically viable (Altieri 1995).

Agroecological techniques include use of cover plants, natural fertilizers, plantations of hedgerows and composting. These are all “sustainable” practices which significantly increase yields without using industrialized fertilisers and other pesticides.

Additionally, “agroecology aims to reduce hunger and improve nutrition by restoring control of food chains to local producer communities. Increased reliance on non-mechanized labour reallocates money from fossil fuels and agribusiness corporations to farming communities, creating additional employment opportunities that bolster local economies.

The participatory processes fostered by agroecology can also strengthen rural community bonds through learning and collaboration, increasing community resilience” (9).

**Benefits of Agroecology and potential impact for nature and people:**

1. Local agroecology will create vegetation and forest cover while feeding the majority of the population. Bringing the local population along also combats deforestation and trains a new generation of sustainable farmers that thrive.
2. Switching from destructive farming systems that destroy the soil and forests, to agroecology principles will provide multiple benefits to nature and farmers…. Paint a picture of the future.

> _**How can we get there you ask?**_

CNC has partnered with Tetikasa Ala, a Non-Profit Organisation, created in 2019 and located in France and Madagascar, with the goal of reintroducing agroecology and fighting against the deforestation of Madagascar.&#x20;

Tetikasa Ala stands for ‘Project Forest’ in malagasy and is run by caring, capable people with a connection to the land and the expertise to implement this strategy.&#x20;

Together we set ourselves a **** goal of planting 100,000 trees on 20 hectares of land. CNC intends to use Cardano Stake Pools to fund their operations through an ISPO.
