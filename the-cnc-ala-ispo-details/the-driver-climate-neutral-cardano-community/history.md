{% hint style="success" %}
Climate Neutral Cardano (CNC) works to achieve a net climate positive impact for the entire Cardano blockchain. It has been started and is maintained by a group of Stake Pool operators since early 2021. All pools are run on 100% renewable energy and all also donate part of their income to environmental charities.&#x20;

At the heart we want to make a real difference to the environment by meeting regularly to help each other and discuss how we can achieve this.

At the start there were only a few Active Stake Pools driving the ideas and slowly building the idea of a carbon neutral Cardano. Meeting weekly or more to ensure Cardano is going to be a solution to the climate crisis and not just another part of the problem.

In order to know the Cardano climate impact, we did some early research on Cardano carbon emissions of the stake pool community. Our [initial calculations](https://www.climateneutralcardano.org/offset-calculation/) from September 2021 determined that planting about **218,000 trees** would be enough to offset the electricity emissions of all Stake Pools at the time.

These calculations got us in touch with the Cardano Foundation and Veritree, with whom we finally partnered on our first community project - the [Cardano Forest](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/how-green-can-the-cardano-community-make-cardanos-blockchain/). After project launch in September 2021 our 9 active CNC members provided carbon inputs, helped answer questions about the Cardano Blockchain and SPOs, met with members from Veritree and the Cardano Foundation regularly, requested regular updates and proof of planting, actively promoted the project, and answered questions from the Cardano community. The Cardano Forest donation goal was achieved in January 2022 - [One million ADA](https://ito.veritree.com/) was raised to plant one million trees in Kenya with a new technology that enables the tracking of these trees on the blockchain for years to come.

Running projects like this is incredibly satisfying, but took a lot of time from our active SPOs on top of their normal jobs and running the actual stake pools. So in order to increase our positive impact we always want to encourage more SPOs to join the group and help with the tasks at hand. Every additional SPO brings us closer to a climate neutral Cardano blockchain!
