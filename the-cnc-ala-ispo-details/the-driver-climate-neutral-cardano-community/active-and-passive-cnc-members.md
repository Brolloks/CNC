# Active and Passive CNC members

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive Members" %}
**Passive CNC members** have to run their nodes on 100% renewable energy and give to environmental charities. They do not have to actively participate in the groupâ€™s meetings and hence are not directly contributing to any projects of the group. However, if you have not got any time to spare, but you donate and run on renewables you are very welcome to join. We want to have as many pools as possible to act on climate change.

On the other hand, if you do have time and want to be part of a buzzing and active community, we would like to encourage you to **become an Active member**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Active Members" %}
**Active CNC members** have to run their servers on 100% renewables and donate to environmental causes just as passive members, but donations should be at least 20% of their income and the should participate in the regular meetings on projects and contribute significantly to the progress of the group and its initiatives, like the Cardano Forest project and the CNC Ala project.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pools that do not run their nodes on 100% renewable energy may participate in the ISPO as temporary Active members of CNC:**

_These Pools participating and donating in the CNC Ala ISPO will be considered offsetting their node energy consumption by means of their donations to the project, so they will qualify for active membership during this period._&#x20;

We also hope that many will continue to stay beyond the ISPO to run more pools on renewables and to fund more environmental projects.
