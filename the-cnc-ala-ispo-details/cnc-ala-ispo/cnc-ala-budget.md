# ðŸ’µ CNC Ala budget

{% hint style="info" %}
To reforest 20 hectares of land for CNC Ala, Tetikasa Ala has provided us with a budget forecast of approximately $300,000 to plant 100,000 fruit, vegetable, and shade plants. This equates to approximately $3 per plant, but it includes funding  for 3 years of work, with 80% of the funding going directly to pay local farmers that do the groundwork while being trained by experts.

#### Pre-ISPO funding

Our Active CNC member pools have started **funding the project since May 2022**, to prepare for the ISPO start. With over 16,000 ADA already donated, we have set up our blockchain accounting, and initial work in Madagascar has begun. This will allow us a rolling start for the ISPO.&#x20;

Transfer of funds, accounting, and reporting were tested and developed in the pre-ISPO phase. Data gathered directly from Madagascar helps us communicate what is happening on the ground.&#x20;

We have already seen the land, the plant nurseries that are being built by the local farmers, in pictures, videos and reports provided to us by Tetikasa Ala

**Planting sites**

The land that will be regenerated is provided by local farmers, the NGO founders, and by the Madagascar government. Tetikasa Ala will have a long term relationship with the sites and land owners to ensure ongoing practices meet with expectations and survivability. Produce (fruits and vegetables), will be community owned.&#x20;

Tetikasa Ala is working on a network of local markets next to the fields which will allow the farmers to sell the products. Tetikasa Ala has established a network of people and buyers who are interested in getting any surplus products from the project.&#x20;

Income generated from sales will come back to the farmers to consolidate their income and strengthen their economic security.

{% tab title="Ranomafana (Phase 1)" %}
Phase 1 funding will enable the development of a 3.6 hectare site in Ranomafana, meaning â€˜hot waterâ€™ in Malagasy. GPS coordinates: 21.289556 S, 47.533944 E This site belongs to Humuni Asso, a Tetikasa Ala NGO partner.

The site is characterised by sloped terrain that still contains some endemic forest, however a large portion of the site was formerly cultivated and terraced, and is now degraded, and with weeds. The plan is to maintain and improve the endemic forest, which will also provide plants and seeds for the other areas. Therefore, the focus will be to regenerate the degraded areas through the establishment of a natural food forest and tree nursery.

Ranomafana is already being funded through the monthly donations contributed by the initial CNC Ala ISPO pools, (original CNC Active members).

{% tab title="Fianarantsoa (Phase 2)" %}
Once the funding milestone for the area of Ranomafana is accomplished, a completely degraded former farmland, called Fianarantsoa "Good education" in Malagasy, will be unlocked for development.&#x20;

This portion of land encompasses an area of 0.7 hectares, located at the GPS coordinates: 21.337340 S, 47.203861 E

**Future sites**

Further sites in the area are available for free from local municipalities if developed by the local community. An additional area of 10-15 hectares has been discussed with the local governments and will become available for development if the first sites are completed or more funding becomes available.

**Plants**

A mix of fruit trees, spices, shade trees and endemic trees will be planted alongside shrubs and vegetables.
