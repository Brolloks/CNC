# ⌛ Timeline

#### Work leading up to the ISPO

CNC was discussing various business models to fund our missions and with the onset of the various ISPO’s models for other projects on Cardano we thought it would be an ideal solution to raise enough funding and offer something in return.

The work on the CNC Ala project really started in February 2022. We learned and worked our way through an endless list of tasks, organising meetings, contacting NFT artists and experts to discuss how best to run our ISPO. While the ideas were plentiful, the practicalities and financial implications had to be carefully evaluated.

Besides the weekly general meetings, every week required task specific discussions and delivery sessions. Hence, we were glad and proud that we finally had all the pieces in place to open up to talk to more Stake Pools in June. This was not only necessary to enable our funding goals, but more importantly we needed the time and skills of many more to ensure that this project would be successful. From the initial 9 active pools we quickly expanded to 20 Stake Pools and are hoping to grow much further before and after the ISPO launch.

**ISPO launch**

{% hint style="info" %}
The actual ISPO launch date will **be announced via our official Social Media accounts**, currently planned for Q4 of 2022 and from this point delegators to participating pools will accumulate CNC Ala tokens that can be redeemed at the end of the ISPO.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The ISPO will last for 6 months from the officially announced start date, with milestone reports and milestone FT’s released every month to log progress on the blockchain. We have determined that running the ISPO for 6 months could potentially allow us to fully fund Tetikasa Ala for the next 3 years and plant 100,000 plants or at least get us very close
