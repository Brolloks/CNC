<details>

<summary>Raise awareness and funding for Tetikasa Ala to create a positive impact for people in Madagascar with a model that can be copied elsewhere on the planet.</summary>

Farmers will be educated in permaculture principles, earn income and generate a permanent source of food.

Our success will mean Tetikasa Ala’s work will be able to expand and become more visible. A success story will attract more funding and do even more good. Furthermore, by making the CNC Ala project a success, SPO’s, delegators, and the Cardano community are raising awareness that blockchain tech and cryptocurrency can bring real positive change to the world.ex

<summary>Bring Cardano to Madagascar and Madagascar to Cardano:</summary>

A few members of the Tetikasa Ala team were somewhat familiar with cryptocurrencies, but they had not yet had any experience with Cardano. CNC helped Tetikasa Ala to set up their own hardware wallet to receive our ADA donations.

However, it was important to establish a reliable and low-cost way to transfer these funds to Madagascar, so they could withdraw what they needed in local currency- MGA. There are still very limited options for Crypto to fiat conversions in Madagascar and it will be important to widen those options through partnerships.

Furthermore, if we can grow the number of people using Cardano directly, the local financial and internet infrastructure can be strengthened.

<summary><strong>Work and grow together as a Cardano Climate Community of SPOs:</strong></summary>

There is so much we can accomplish for both Cardano and climate action, if we work together. After learning so much from the work we put into our projects, CNC wishes to share what we’ve learned with other like-minded SPOs, groups, and individuals. This collaboration would both save time and effort for anyone interested, and multiply our effectiveness.

<details>

<summary><strong>Communication and Marketing for all:</strong></summary>

One of the biggest challenges that we have faced as SPO's and as a team launching a project is marketing. We learned that much of a project's effectiveness comes down to marketing, and by using the combined voices of our SPO members and supporters, together with one focussed message we can reach out much further. Our voices can both contribute to the success of our partner SPO's, the CNC Ala project, and any other initiative by CNC group members.

<summary><strong>Showcase mission driven pools and engage delegators:</strong></summary>

The CNC Ala ISPO provides a great way to showcase the efforts of mission driven pools in the Cardano community. By working on a large-scale group project like this, producing visible impacts they can communicate and share, mission-driven SPOs have something significant to put their name to, and have desirable rewards with utility, to offer both new and existing delegators.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Attract up to 100 participating SPOs to achieve our funding goals:</strong></summary>

In order to reach our goal of 100,000 plants in Madagascar, we’d like to have up to 100 participating SPOs in the CNC Ala project. We do have smaller goals set that can still be achieved if we do not reach the desired number of SPOs participating, but with such excellent rewards, partners, and project, we do think this is entirely achievable.

<details>

<summary><strong>Attract new impact-participation to the Cardano blockchain:</strong></summary>

Cardano is a blockchain for change-drivers. Large scale projects that impact the world in a real way make the news, and reach people outside of the crypto ecosystem, attracting i.e. NGOs, environmentalists or just people who care to help.\
\
By making the CNC Ala project a success, the Cardano community can add another point to its score of victories, and attract more people who are outside of the current Cardano ecosystem.

<details>

<summary><strong>Learn to build a project together and have fun:</strong></summary>

Being a part of the CNC Ala project is about working together. Everyone that participates has valuable experience and knowledge that can be contributed to make the project even better. Large-scale projects take a lot of work to plan, build, and execute, but together we can make CNC Ala and future projects a success story. Be sure to make this a project you enjoy, meet some amazing people along the way, and have fun!
