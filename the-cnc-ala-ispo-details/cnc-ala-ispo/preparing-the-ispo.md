# ðŸ›  Preparing the ISPO

### **Lessons from the Cardano Forest project**

From our previous experience with the Cardano Forest project, the CNC group learned what is necessary for working on a large project together with partners, including project management, communication and consensus and that it is important to have a direct connection to the NGO team working on the ground. One of the challenging aspects of the Cardano Forest project was getting regular photo and video updates of the tree planting, which donors often asked for.

This is where it became clear to us that we wanted to work directly with an NGO that would have that capability to talk to us and report back from the beginning so we could communicate what is actually happening on the ground.\


We found just such a partner in the Tetikasa Ala NGO. Their vision to re-green Madagascar while enabling local inhabitants to provide food security for themselves is a perfect fit (more Tetikasa Ala details below). Though Tetikasa Ala seemed like a kindred spirit to ourselves, we were still aware that they are a small new NGO that we didnâ€™t know and were far away.

### **The original pools**

Nine Active CNC member pools did the initial work to prepare the ISPO over several months. These pools in reverse alphabetical order are:

YOON, SHIFT, RSV, GRANA, GAIA, ECO, CO2P, BIO, ARM1 and without them there would be no CNC Ala.

However, although the above pools were the major drivers initially, after many hours of work it became clear more resources, skills and time would be needed to ensure we can deliver on all goals. Since Cardano has a large community that cares, we steadily grew to have many more pools, NFT artists, writers and community members that wanted to help and would be essential to both launch and successfully deliver CNC Ala.

### **NGO auditing**

To ensure Tetikasa Ala was indeed a registered and acting NGO in Madagascar (and France) we got in touch with other NGOs and auditors in Madagascar. We also requested NGO details as well as reports from earlier funding they received from the french government to get their project started.

All checks came back positive and during the first 6 months of building our connections, we managed to onboard the NGO to Cardano and built the accounting and reporting processes. The original nine Active CNC member Pools then started to donate to the NGO to allow them to start their amazing work instead of waiting until all details of the ISPO were finalised.&#x20;

Since then several reports including pictures and video files have shown us progress and a beautiful project coming to life.

### **Project management as a decentralized SPO community - a consensus**

Besides the above due diligence checks, our CNC community had to prepare an ISPO, which required a great deal of project management and even though a few successful ISPOs were already out there the details had to be worked out together by a decentralised SPO community.

All SPOs and partners are volunteering their time and donate their own ADA whenever they can, but CNC is not a company with paid workers and a management team for coordination. So we had to work together driven by our vision and with the skills and resources available to us, showcasing what our community can do together. Many of these details are compiled in this white paper after a lot of research, proposals and endless discussions as a group.&#x20;

For each decision a consensus has been formed and the ISPO is a reflection of our community learning, strengths and the conviction that we found a worthwhile project and NGO to support - Tetikasa Ala.
