# 👫 How can SPO's participate?

We would like to invite the Cardano community to participate in our ISPO by staking with CNC pools so that this impactful project can generate ongoing funding to successfully plant the CNC Forest.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
By staking with us you not only empower our pools to generate more blocks and increase the outcome of donations with it, but you will also get rewarded for it with the CNC token and NFTs from Cardano Proxies, Yummi Universe, Earth Natives and M₳D₳’s Lemur.
{% endhint %}

Cardano community members will also have opportunities to donate directly to the project, like when claiming the NFT rewards they’ve earned.
