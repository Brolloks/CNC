# ðŸ‘« How can SPO's participate?

We would like to invite the Cardano community to participate in our ISPO by staking with CNC Active Member pools so that this impactful project can generate ongoing funding to successfully plant the CNC Forest.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
By staking with CNC Active Member pools do you as a delegator not only empower our pools to produce more blocks and increase the outcome of donations with it, but you will also accumulate the CNC token which will be redeemable for NFTs from Cardano Proxies, Yummi Universe, Earth Natives and Mâ‚³Dâ‚³â€™s Lemur.
{% endhint %}

Cardano community members will also have opportunities to donate directly to the project, like when claiming the NFT rewards theyâ€™ve earned.
