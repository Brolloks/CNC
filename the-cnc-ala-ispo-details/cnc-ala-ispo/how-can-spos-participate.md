# ðŸ‘« How can SPO's participate?

We would like to invite the Cardano community to participate in our ISPO by staking with [CNC ISPO pools](https://climateneutralcardano.org/cnc-ala-ispo-eligible-pools/) to help us support Tetikasa Ala.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
By staking with CNC ISPO pools you as a delegator not only empower our pools to produce more blocks and increase donations, but you will also accumulate the CNC token which will qualify staking wallets for NFT airdrops from Cardano Proxies, Yummi Universe, Earth Natives and Mâ‚³Dâ‚³â€™s Lemur.&#x20;

At any time delegators will be able to check their stake token accumulation on the CNC Ala project statistics website.
{% endhint %}

Cardano community members will also have opportunities to donate directly to the project, like when claiming the NFT rewards theyâ€™ve earned.
