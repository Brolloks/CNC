# ðŸš€ ISPO's as model for future charity funding

CNC will continue to work together on future projects to help our planet reach carbon neutrality, and to raise awareness of Cardano. For future projects, our CNC tokens may be used in voting by community members to decide which projects we will work on next.

We are also working with [Blockcarbon](https://blockcarbon.io/) in an effort to create carbon credits from our projects. The carbon credit process is long term, with a minimum of 5 years of time invested before a project can qualify. CNC has started the process, and we intend to have our projects qualify for carbon credits in the future. (link to carbon credits info needed)
